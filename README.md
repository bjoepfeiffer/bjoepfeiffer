## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brandon Pfeiffer. I am a software engineer with an extensive background in full stack development. While most of my experience has been with React, Angular, Node, C#, and PHP, I am known to hit the ground running with new technologies and contribute from day one. My ability to listen to customers, understand their requirements, and quickly materialize robust and tested applications has always led me to success.

I am looking to work in a fast-paced environment with other driven, humble, and capable individuals. Not only do I have a lot of experience to share, but I also know that there is always more to learn from the people around me.
